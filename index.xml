      <description>Background Recently I came across an interesting issue. My University runs a field station at a rural property called Newholme where a grid of camera traps has been set up a few years back. Cameras are solar-powered and form a mesh network where photos are relayed from each camera to the base station located at the station building. Unfortunately, due to a firmware bug, for the first few years, the EXIF data was wiped from each photo as it was relayed so we could only get the date and time when the file was saved on the base station, which could be minutes or days after it was taken.</description>

      <description>My name is Michał Śmielak. I&amp;rsquo;m an wildlife biologist, working in the field handling animals and in the office wrangling data. Originally from Poland, over the years I have been involved in projects in Europe, Australia and Africa.
I am interested in various aspects of animal ecology, including (but not limited to) behavioural ecology of mammals, reptiles and amphibians, conservation, ecosystem management and human-wildlife conflicts.
I write code (mostly in R) to transform raw data collected in the field into results and conservation outcomes.</description>

      <description>I take photos, mostly of nature and landscapes. Some of my photos won awards in competitions.
I am always happy to give permission for my photos to be used for a good cause. If you are a non-profit and would like to use one of my photos to promote your work, an educational or conservation project, please get in touch with me.
If you want to buy one of my photos - either as a print or for digital use, send me a message and we can work out details.</description>

      <description>Below you will find various examples of reproductible code that I came up with over the years - mostly functions and packages developed in R to help with ecological data analysis. Hopefully, this will be updated over time.
 moonlit package 
moonlit - R package I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing since 2018. It is a model to predict moonlight intensity on the ground for any given place and time, based on the position of the moon and a number of correction factors.</description>

      <description>Various electronic bibs and bobs, mostly for use in wildlife research.
 wilduino 
wilduino is a project of an animal-borne logger. In its concept, it is a modular, open-source device consisting of a microcontroller board and a range of &amp;ldquo;shields&amp;rdquo;, similar to Arduino design, but much smaller and optimised for low power consumption. First prototypes include GPS, 9 DOF IMU and altimeter to track 3D movements of animals. Baseboard (Arduino-based) also has LoRa communication.</description>
