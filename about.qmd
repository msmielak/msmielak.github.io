My name is Michał Śmielak. I\'m an wildlife biologist, working in the field handling animals and in the office wrangling data. Originally from Poland, over the years I have been involved in projects in Europe, Australia and Africa.

I am interested in various aspects of animal ecology, including (but not limited to) behavioural ecology of mammals, reptiles and amphibians, conservation, ecosystem management and human-wildlife conflicts.

I write code (mostly in R) to transform raw data collected in the field into results and conservation outcomes. I also build custom research equipment, often using Arduino and other open-source platforms, usually when there is no off-the-shelf solution to measure something and sometimes just for fun.

This website is hopefully going to be a repository of my various projects and a way to share them with fellow researchers.
