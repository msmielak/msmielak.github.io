**wilduino** is a project of an animal-borne logger. In its concept, it is a modular, open-source device consisting of a microcontroller board and a range of "shields", similar to Arduino design, but much smaller and optimised for low power consumption. First prototypes include GPS, 9 DOF IMU and altimeter to track 3D movements of animals. Baseboard (Arduino-based) also has LoRa communication.

The wilduino project is currently on hold, but PCB design and rudimentary code is available in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/msmielak/wilduino/).

This project was co-funded by the Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment.
