Below you will find various examples of reproducible code that I came up with over the years - mostly functions and packages developed in R to help with ecological data analysis. Hopefully, this will be updated over time.

# moonlit package

**moonlit** - R package I've been developing since 2018. It is a model to predict moonlight intensity on the ground for any given place and time, based on the position of the moon and a number of correction factors. It provides illumination measures that are much more biologically meaningful than moon phase, particularly useful in behavioural ecology and ALAN (artificial light at night) studies.

This package is available from a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/msmielak/moonlit).
